- **Categorization & Profiling**: Comprehensive item profiles with detailed metadata and purchase history.

### Comprehensive GST Compliance
- **Automated Tax Calculations**: Built-in logic for CGST, SGST, and IGST.
- **HSN Code Autocomplete**: Smart prediction of harmonized system nomenclature for seamless compliance.
- **GST Returns**: Automated report generation and formatting.

### Advanced Dashboard & Analytics
- **Financial Insights**: Real-time sales charts, credit reports, and recent transaction monitoring.
